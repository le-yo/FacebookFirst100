#### Curious about some of the first facebook users?

This is a quick code done due to curiosity. Just wanted to find out the facebook users with user ID 1 to 100. 

Data used is available publicly via graph.facebook.com 

Feel free to clone, fork, distribute code in any way you want. 

Runs on codeigniter from Ellislab but the script should run on it own as I am not invoking any models or database. 
## Installation

Derived from CodeIgniter, read [CodeIgniter Installation](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html) for how to install using this [zipball](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/zipball/master) instead. If you're not familiar with CodeIgniter, I suggest reading the [CodeIgniter Tutorial](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html) on how to get started and read the [wiki](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/wiki) for more information.

Just clone, fork etc
